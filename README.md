# Night Vision

### Personal Note

>Honestly, what began as a joke soon turned into a test of my skills. I faced numerous challenges along the way, and I'm very satisfied with how it all turned out.

### Materials
* **Raspberry Pi**
* **PS3 Eye Camera.** Any USB camera with removed IR filter would do.
* **Waveshare 2inch Display**
* **Some Jumper Cables**
* **IR Flaslight.** 850nm for better results.
* **Face Protective Visor with Removed Visor.**
* **Concave Lens.** -> Attach it into IR Flaslight to make the light diverge.
